## What is Join?
**Join** is a kanban-based project management tool that helps you manage tasks and projects using an intuitive interface. Based on the principles of Kanban, a method for visualizing work and optimizing efficiency, Join provides a platform where users can create and track tasks through various stages of progress.

Join was developed as an educational project by a group of students. It is not designed for commercial use but serves as a showcase of our skills learned during our web development bootcamp.

## How to Use Join

### Exploring the Board
Once you log in to Join, youâ€™ll see a default board representing your project. This board includes four lists to help organize your tasks:
- **To Do**: Tasks that need to be started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Await Feedback**: Tasks pending approval or review.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

### Creating Contacts
In the "Contacts" section, you can add collaborators to your project. To create a new contact:
1. Go to the "Contacts" section.
2. Click "Add new Contact".
3. Fill in the required fields.

### Adding Cards
To add a new task:
1. Click the "+" button under the relevant list.
2. Fill in the card details such as task name, description, due date, and assign it to the responsible person.
3. Click "Save" to add the card to the board.

### Moving Cards
To update the status of a task, simply drag the card to a different list:
- **In Progress** for tasks you are working on.
- **Await Feedback** for tasks that need review.
- **Done** for completed tasks.

### Completing Tasks
Once a task is finished, move it to the **Done** list. Ensure all requirements are met, and no further changes are necessary.

## Disclaimer
**Join** is an educational project and is not intended for extensive business use. We strive to provide the best user experience, but cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, or accuracy of the tool.
